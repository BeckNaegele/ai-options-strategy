## üìñ Usage Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Enter a Ticker Symbol**
   - Type any valid stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, SPY)
   - Click "Load Data" button

2. **Select Expiration Date**
   - Choose from available options expiration dates
   - The system will load the complete options chain

3. **Configure Parameters**
   - Adjust risk-free rate (typically 4-6% for US Treasury rates)
   - Set binomial tree steps (higher = more accurate but slower)
   - Input your portfolio value
   - Set risk percentage per trade (typically 1-5%)

## üìä Technical Details

### Options Pricing Models

**Black-Scholes Model**:
- Used for European-style options
- Analytical solution
- Fast computation

**Binomial Tree Model**:
- Used for American-style options
- Accounts for early exercise premium
- Configurable number of steps for accuracy

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- Generates thousands of price paths using geometric Brownian motion
- Provides probability distributions for price at expiration
- Calculates expected payoffs for different strike prices

### Machine Learning Models

**Decision Tree Regressor**:
- Features: Moving averages, volatility, momentum, RSI, lagged prices
- Max depth: 10, Min samples split: 10

**"No expiration dates available"**:
- Stock may not have listed options
- Try a more liquid stock (e.g., AAPL, SPY)

- Try a different ticker with longer history

**"Model training failed"**:
- May occur with very new stocks
- Increase the time period for historical data
- Try a more established company

### Performance Tips

- Use fewer Monte Carlo simulations for faster results (1,000-5,000)
- Reduce binomial tree steps for quicker calculations (50-100)
- Analyze fewer strikes by selecting a narrower price range
- Close unused browser tabs to free up memory
