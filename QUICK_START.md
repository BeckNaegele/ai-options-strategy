## Example Walkthrough

### Analyzing Apple (AAPL)

1. Enter **AAPL** in the ticker box
2. Click **Load Data**
3. Select an expiration date (try 30-60 days out)
4. Keep default settings initially
5. Review the top recommendations

### Understanding a Recommendation

**Example Output:**
```
BUY CALL - CALL @ $150.00
Confidence: HIGH | Valuation: UNDERVALUED

Market Price: $5.50
Fair Value: $6.20
Value Diff: -11.29%
Probability ITM: 58.3%
Expected Payoff: $8.45
Position Size: 3 contracts
Total Cost: $1,650.00
```

**What this means:**
- The $150 call is trading **below** fair value (undervalued by 11.29%)
- There's a 58.3% chance it will be in-the-money at expiration
- The AI recommends buying **3 contracts**
- Total investment would be **$1,650** (3 √ó $550)
- This represents **1.65%** of a $100,000 portfolio

## Tips for Best Results

### ‚úÖ Good Tickers to Analyze
- **Large Cap Stocks**: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA

## Common Questions

### Q: How accurate are the predictions?
A: The models provide educated estimates based on historical data. No model can predict the future with certainty. Always use as one tool among many.

### Q: Should I trade based on these recommendations?
A: **NO!** This is an educational tool. Always do your own research, consider your risk tolerance, and consult a financial advisor.

### Q: What if I see "Unable to load data"?
A: Try these solutions:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try a different ticker symbol
3. Wait a moment and try again (API may be rate-limited)

### Q: Why are some options marked as "HOLD"?
A: The AI marks options as HOLD when:
- They're fairly priced (not undervalued or overvalued)
- They have low liquidity (volume/open interest)
- The probability of profit is low
- The risk-adjusted return is unfavorable

### Q: Can I analyze multiple strategies?
A: The current version analyzes single-leg strategies (buying calls/puts). Multi-leg strategies (spreads, straddles) could be added in future versions.

## Performance Tips

- **Slow loading?** Reduce Monte Carlo trials to 5,000
- **Analysis taking too long?** Reduce binomial steps to 50
- **Want more accuracy?** Increase both parameters (will be slower)

## Safety Reminders
